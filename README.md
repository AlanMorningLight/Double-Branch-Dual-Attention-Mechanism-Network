# Hyperspectral Image Classification

This repository implementates 6 frameworks for hyperspectral image classification based on PyTorch and sklearn.

The detailed results can be seen in the [Classification of Hyperspectral Image Based on 
Double-Branch Dual-Attention Mechanism Network ]().

Requirementsï¼š
------- 
```
numpy >= 1.16.5
PyTorch >= 1.3.1
sklearn >= 0.20.4
```

Datasets:
------- 
You can download the hyperspectral datasets in mat format at: [](http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes), and move the files to `./datasets` folder.

Usage:
------- 
1. Set the percentage of training and validation samples by the `load_dataset` function in the file `./global_module/generate_pic.py`.
2. Taking the DBDA framework as an example, run `./DBDA/main.py` and type the name of dataset. 
3. The classfication maps are obtained in `./DBDA/classification_maps` folder, and accuracy result is generated in `./DBDA/records` folder.
